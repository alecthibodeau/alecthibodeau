### What I like doing

I'm a software developer specializing in the front end, the user experience (UX), user interfaces (UI), digital accessibility and responsive web design. I build front-end websites from scratch using&hellip;
- React
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- CSS (and Sass)
- HTML

### What I also like doing

With a background in art I can make design elements and website prototypes myself or collaborate directly with UX designers. Having recently taught Advanced UX/UI at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth I'm continuing my explorations in software development. Visit my [code portfolio site](https://alect.me).
