### What I like doing

I'm a software developer and a visual artist, focusing on front-end web development, the user experience (UX), user interfaces (UI), digital accessibility and responsive web design. My favorite technology tools are React, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

### What I also like doing

I'm happy to craft design elements and website prototypes myself or collaborate directly with UX designers. Having recently taught Advanced UX/UI at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth I'm continuing my explorations in software development. Visit my portfolio site: [alect.me](https://alect.me).
