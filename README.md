### My skills

I'm a software developer specializing in the front end, the user experience (UX), user interfaces (UI), digital accessibility and responsive web design. I develop software primarily with:
- React
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- CSS (and Sass)
- HTML

### What I like doing

With a background in art and design I enjoy working directly with UX designers and sharing a common visual language with them. Having recently taught Advanced UX/UI at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth for the school's 2024 spring semester I'm continuing my explorations in front-end web development.
